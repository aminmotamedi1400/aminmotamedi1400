# Hello World
## Introduction to Graph Algorithms

This exercise delves into the core concepts of graph theory and implements several fundamental algorithms used for traversing and analyzing graph structures. Understanding these algorithms is crucial for working with social networks, where relationships can be modeled as graphs.

### Part 1: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS)

You will implement both BFS and DFS algorithms to traverse a given social network graph.
*   **BFS:** Useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph and for understanding network layers.
*   **DFS:** Good for detecting cycles and exploring components of a graph.

**Tasks:**
1.  Implement BFS for a given adjacency list representation of a graph.
2.  Implement DFS using both recursive and iterative approaches.
3.  Analyze the time and space complexity of both algorithms.

### Part 2: Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is a classic method for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which is particularly useful in routing and navigation systems.

**Tasks:**
1.  Implement Dijkstra's algorithm for a weighted graph.
2.  Test your implementation on a small social network graph with varying edge weights (e.g., representing interaction frequency).
3.  Discuss the limitations of Dijkstra's algorithm and when other algorithms (like Bellman-Ford) might be more suitable.

### Submission Guidelines

*   Submit your code in a Python notebook (`.ipynb`) or a PDF report.
*   Clearly comment your code and provide explanations for your algorithmic choices.
*   Include screenshots of your results for each part.

**Due Date:** November 1, 2025
